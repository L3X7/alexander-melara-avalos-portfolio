The goal was to replace these disconnected processes with a unified, transparent marketplace that simplifies complex B2B negotiations while providing verifiable sustainability metrics."

The backend architecture, built with NestJS and Prisma, manages complex state machines for multi-stage negotiations and order fulfillment. On the frontend, we utilized Next.js to create a clean, data-dense interface that allows logistics managers to visualize material flows instantly. The system abstracts the complexity of circular logistics, presenting users with actionable insights on resource recovery rates and transaction status in real-time."
